## User Roles

| Role                  | Login                         | Portal     |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------- |
| **Student**           | Google OAuth (`@iiitd.ac.in`) | `/student` |
| **Manager**           | Credentials (manual DB entry) | `/manager` |
| **Admin / Superuser** | Credentials (manual DB entry) | `/admin`   |

Role is stored in `profiles.role`. Middleware redirects users to their correct portal on every request.

---

## Getting Started

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
cd web
npm install

# 2. Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env.local
# Fill in: DATABASE_URL, AUTH_SECRET, AUTH_GOOGLE_ID, AUTH_GOOGLE_SECRET

# 3. Run Drizzle migrations
npm run db:migrate

# 4. Apply stored procedures (once)
# Run web/src/db/stored-procedures.sql against your Postgres instance

# 5. Start development server
npm run dev
```

App runs at `http://localhost:3000`.

---

## Environment Variables

```env
# PostgreSQL connection string
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/disa

# NextAuth — generate secret with: openssl rand -base64 32
AUTH_SECRET=your-secret

# Google OAuth (from Google Cloud Console)
AUTH_GOOGLE_ID=your-google-client-id
AUTH_GOOGLE_SECRET=your-google-client-secret
```

Google OAuth redirect URI: `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google`  
Domain restriction: only `@iiitd.ac.in` accounts are allowed through.

---

## Database Management

```bash
npm run db:generate   # generate new migration from schema changes
npm run db:migrate    # apply pending migrations
npm run db:push       # push schema directly (dev only)
npm run db:studio     # open Drizzle Studio (visual DB browser)
```

Migrations live in `drizzle/`. Schema is defined in `src/db/schema.ts`.

---

## CI/CD Pipeline

GitHub Actions (`/.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs on every push / PR to `main`:

| Step             | Command                   | Notes                                               |
| ---------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Format           | `npm run format:check`    | Prettier                                            |
| Lint             | `npm run lint`            | ESLint — rules are `warn`, not `error`              |
| Type-check app   | `npm run type-check`      | Excludes tests                                      |
| Type-check tests | `npm run type-check:test` | Covers `src/__tests__/**`                           |
| Tests + coverage | `npm run test:coverage`   | Thresholds: lines/functions ≥ 70 %, branches ≥ 60 % |
| Build            | `npm run build`           | After quality + test jobs pass                      |

No real DB or credentials are needed — the test suite mocks the Drizzle connection and Auth.js session entirely.

---

## Running Tests

```bash
npm test              # run all tests (vitest)
npm run test:watch    # watch mode
npm run test:coverage # coverage report
npm run test:ui       # Vitest UI
```

Test files live in `src/__tests__/`:

| Directory      | Contents                                                    |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `actions/`     | Unit tests for all server actions                           |
| `api/`         | Route handler tests (auth, notifications, upload, play-req) |
| `components/`  | Component tests (notification popup, notifications client)  |
| `integration/` | Booking flow end-to-end                                     |
| `concurrency/` | Concurrent operation stress tests                           |
| `lib/`         | Utility tests (upload validation, sport config)             |

## Key Features

### Student Portal

## Points & Ban System

| Event                                 | Δ Points |
| ------------------------------------- | -------- |
| Session completed (all good)          | +10      |
| Session completed (no equipment)      | +8       |
| Session completed (minor damage)      | +7       |
| Session completed (equipment damaged) | 0        |
| Late cancellation (< 3 hrs)           | −3       |
| Booking timeout                       | −8       |
| Rejection: students late              | −6       |
| Rejection: improper gear              | −4       |
| Rejection: inappropriate behaviour    | −8       |
| Post-session: late end                | −4       |
| Post-session: vandalism               | −15      |
| Equipment lost                        | −20      |

**Monthly reset**: triggered on first leaderboard visit of the month. Top 5 get `priority_booking_remaining = 1`.  
**14-day ban**: after 3 `students_late` violations.  
**Account suspension**: 3+ total violations → blocked from booking until admin clears.
